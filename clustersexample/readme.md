Clusters#

This module runs in the background.

All you have to do is run/start the zero-downtime.js source code and point your RPC Client/Server and the blockchain server to anyone of the worker ports you will see in your terminal and enjoy. Don't forget to get your keypair first. 
Read the main readme.md for more instructions.

Please refer to the "Clusters" and "What Is Clusters?" Wiki Link for a breakdown of the clusters module and how it is used with JellyChain1.

An experimental smart contract blockchain network

## What is Ekehi Network?

Ekehi Network is a blockchain network platform that supports smart contracts and can act as a payment system/cryptocurrency. It is originally and still is made for experimental and educational purposes, you can have a brief look at its core ideas by following the instructions below.

## Setup a node

### Dependencies 

* NodeJS v16 or higher.
* Latest release of npm.

### Requirements

A system that is running Windows, Linux, or MacOS with a dual-core CPU and 8GB of RAM with a mediocre SSD/HDD should be enough.

### Installation

First, download the latest release from: 

Extract the zip file, in the `JellyChain1` folder, open up your terminal and install the required packages through `npm`:

```
npm install
```

### Generate your keys

If you haven't had an Ekehi Network key pair before, hop over to `./utils/`, on the command line, type:

```
node keygen.js
```

And it will generate an address, a public key and a private key for you.

### Configure your node

In `config.json`, change the props for your needs:

```js
{
    "PORT": /*PORT that your node will run on, default is 3000*/,
    "RPC_PORT": /*PORT that the RPC server will run on, default is 5000*/,
    "PEERS": /*An array containing peers' address that the node will connect with, default is an empty array*/, 
    "MY_ADDRESS": /*A string containing the node's address, default is "localhost:3000"*/,
    "PRIVATE_KEY": /*A string containing a private key*/,
    "ENABLE_MINING": /*Leave true if you want to mine, default is false*/
    "ENABLE_LOGGING": /*Leave true if you want to log out contract logs, default is false*/,
    "ENABLE_RPC": /*Leave true if you want to run a RPC server, default is false*/,
    "ENABLE_CHAIN_REQUEST": /*Leave true if you want to sync chain from others, default is false*/
}
```

To see an example, `config.json` already has some data set for you to have a look at.

### Running the node

After everything is all set, simply type `node .` to run the node.

### Interacting with the node through JSON-RPC apis

This process will need you to run an RPC server, basically leave `true` in `ENABLE_RPC` in `config.json` to enable it.

To properly interact with the node, you should use the JSON-RPC apis, especially if you are creating dapps. To get started, check out [docs for JSON-RPC APIs here.](./JSON-RPC.md)

**Note: This feature is still in its early stages, things might change when a stable release is ready.**

### Run Ekehi Network node publicly
Located under Clusters/zerodowtime.js:

This module runs in the background.

All you have to do is run/start the zero-downtime.js source code and point your RPC Client/Server and the blockchain server to anyone of the worker ports you will see in your terminal and enjoy. Don't forget to get your keypair first.

## Smart contracts?

Smart contract is still a fairly new feature in JellyChain1. It is only a proof of concept currently and is likely going to change in the future, but for now, you can read [this document](./CONTRACT.md) on creating smart contracts using a small language I have created called `jellyscript`.

Remember to only use it for experimental purposes, I can not guarantee that this feature will be changed or not in the future. The language is also really limited and far from ready.


## Economy 

Note that this is an experimental project which is still under development, and an agreed JellyChain1 network hasn't been formed yet, so this section is mainly just for fun.

### Units

| Unit       | Wei                       |

### Tokenomic

* 100000000 EKH is minted originally.
* Current mining reward is 0.202297 EKH.
* Minimum transation fee is 1000000000000 Wei.
* Minimum contract execution fee is 10000000 Wei.

## Support the project!

I have been maintaining the project in my free time, if you like JellyChain1 and want to support, you can just leave a star and feel free to open issues and pull requests!

Thanks a lot!


## Using the project's source code

Ekehi Network is 100% open-source, but if you are integrating its source code into your own project, it would be lovely if you credit the original Ekehi Network, I would really appreciate it!
